# RTLtoGDS_RISC_V_VSD_IITGN
This repository presents my hands-on expertise in the digital ASIC design flow from RTL to GDSII. Each module demonstrates a critical stage of the VLSI frontend and backend process, integrating open-source EDA tools (Yosys, iverilog, gtkwave, ngspice, magic, OpenLane) to build, verify, and layout custom digital blocks for RISC_V processor.
